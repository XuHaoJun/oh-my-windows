# oh-my-windows

Automatic install my windows softwares.

## QuickStart

- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager, for most packages.

- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) command-line installer, for custom packages.

Run `install.cmd` and will request permission for global install, `chocolatey-packages.config` and `scoop-packages.txt` is list of packages.

## TODO

1. Add Line, NoxPlayer and Battle.net package.
2. Migrate chocolatey to scoop.
